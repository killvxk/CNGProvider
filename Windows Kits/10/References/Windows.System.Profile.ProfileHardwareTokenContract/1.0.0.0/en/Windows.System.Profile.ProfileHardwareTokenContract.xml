      <summary>Provides the ability to obtain a hardware identifier that represents the current hardware.</summary>
    </member><member name="M:Windows.System.Profile.HardwareIdentification.GetPackageSpecificToken(Windows.Storage.Streams.IBuffer)">
      <summary>Gets a hardware identifier (ASHWID) that represents the current hardware.</summary>
      <returns>The hardware Id information.</returns>
      <param name="nonce">The cryptographic nonce is optional. The nonce is recommended when ASHWID needs to be verified on the cloud against replay attacks. In the scenarios where nonce is desired, the remote server should generate a random nonce and pass it to the client app, and then verify that the signature has the expected nonce once the ASHWID is received from the client system.</param>

      <summary>Represents a token that contains a hardware based identification that is sufficiently unique.</summary>
    </member><member name="P:Windows.System.Profile.HardwareToken.Certificate">
      <summary>Gets the certificate that is used to sign the Id and is used to help verify the authenticity of the Id.</summary>

      <summary>Gets the hardware identifier that identifies the device.</summary>
      <returns>The id that identifies the device. This byte buffer contains a set of identifiers that represent the various hardware components found in the device.</returns>
