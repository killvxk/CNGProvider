      <summary>The service provided by the ControlChannelTrigger is unavailable. This can happen if the network connection broker service is not yet ready but the app is trying to establish a ControlChannelTrigger channel. This status code is provided under the following conditions: When there is fast user switching and the new user is trying to establish the ControlChannelTrigger channel. When the system is entering a low power mode (Connected standby mode) and the app is trying to create a software slot. Software slots are available only when the system is active and not in low power mode. The mitigation in both these cases is to listen for System Event broker events and register the ControlChannelTrigger channel at that point.</summary>
